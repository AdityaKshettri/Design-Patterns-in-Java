# Composite

Composite is a structural design pattern that lets you compose objects into tree structures and then work with these
structures as if they were individual objects.

Composite became a pretty popular solution for the most problems that require building a tree structure. Composite’s
great feature is the ability to run methods recursively over the whole tree structure and sum up the results.

*Hint: *

- Simple and Complex objects of similar behaviour.
- Recursive calls on objects
- Tree-like structure
